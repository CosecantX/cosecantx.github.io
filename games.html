                Aim with your mouse, shoot by holding your left mouse button, use your grappling hook by holding your right mouse button. 
                A/D to move, W/S to extend/retract your grappling hook's rope, space to jump.

            <p>Link to <a href="./games/capture/index.html">Capture</a>, Click on an empty space to place a new piece, click a piece to move it. 
                The dark grey squares are castles, and the 8 surrounding tiles are their lands. 
                Click to add a piece to a land as long as you own that castle. 
                You can move your pieces in 8 directions, and jump over enemy pieces. 
                You can make multiple jumps with the same piece over the same turn.
                Game over when you're done playing, when here's no more meaningful moves available, or when one side has no pieces left.
                I don't have an actual gameover state programmed in, unfortunately.
